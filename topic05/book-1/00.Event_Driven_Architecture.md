# Event Driven Architecture.

In this lab, we will use a skeleton application as the context to demonstrate the event-driven architecture style. The AWS services used will include S3, SQS (Simple Queue Service), SNS (Simple Notification Service), SES (Simple Email Service), Lambda, and DynamoDB. The app allows users to upload an image file to an S3 bucket. This action will start a flow of events/messages through the application using the SQS and SNS services and trigger a lambda functions to perform some logic.

__[NOTE: This lab work must be submitted to Moodle when completed. You must type the exact git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment. You should spread the effort required to complete the lab over the period provided. See below for submission details.]__

-----------------------------

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ npm install
$ cdk deploy
~~~
The stack consists of a single S3 bucket, for now. 

In the web management console, go to the S3 service:

![][bucket]

Note the bucket name in the terminal output; we will need it later:

![][terminal]

### Submission.

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ds-eda-lab'. In VS Code, make this the remote origin repo: repository for this project using the command:
~~~bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
~~~

Create a text file called 'eda-Lab.txt' and paste the URL of your repo into it. Submit the text file on Moodle at [this link][submit].
