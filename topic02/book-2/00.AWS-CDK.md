# The Cloud Development Kit (CDK).


The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) lets you define cloud infrastructure as code in various programming languages - we will use Typescript. Once defined, you can then provision the resources of that infrastructure using the CDK CLI.

### CDK Bootstrap.

Install the AWS CDK CLI globally using the following command (use the VS Code integrated terminal for convenience):

```bash
$ npm install -g aws-cdk@2.156.0
```

Run the following command to verify a correct installation:

```bash
$ cdk --version
```

To deploy resources using the AWS CDK framework, your AWS account requires a dedicated S3 bucket and some other containers to be available - the AWS CloudFormation service uses them when provisioning infrastructure for an application. Creating these CDK-specific resources is called **bootstrapping**. First, you need to discover the 12-digit identification number for your AWS account using the following command:

```bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
```

Now bootstrap your AWS account with the following command:

```bash
$ cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/eu-west-1
```

> > e.g. cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/eu-west-1

---

**NOTE:** The above command assumes you are using your **default profile credentials** to access your AWS account. If you have multiple AWS accounts and wish to use a specific one for this module then include the --profile option in the command, e.g.

```bash
$ cdk --profile myProfileName bootstrap aws://YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/eu-west-1
```

In fact, all cdk commands must include the --profile option in this scenario.

---

Confirm that this worked by navigating to the CloudFormation service in the AWS web management console and checking for the presence of the CDKToolkit stack:

![][boot]

The CDKToolkit stack owns the S3 bucket that store assets required by the CDK framework. **NEVER DELETE** any resources created by the bootstrapping process.
