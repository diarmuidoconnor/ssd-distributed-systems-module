+ Skip through the remaining steps and create the account. Download the user's CSV credentials file using the button provided.

+ We need to generate a set of access keys for the user to allow them to use the AWS CLI. Go to the main IAM page, and select Users on the left panel, and select the user in the list displayed.

+ Select the Security Credentials panel on the page.

-----------------------------------


You now use the downloaded access keys to configure the AWS CLI on your local computer. (assuming you have installed the CLI already) From the command line type:
~~~bash
$ aws configure
~~~
Enter the two access keys from the CSV file and set the Region to eu-west-1.

Test that it worked with:
~~~bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
~~~
It should respond with youe 12-digit account number.
