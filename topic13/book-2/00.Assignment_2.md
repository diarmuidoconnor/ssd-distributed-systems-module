## Distributed Systems - Assignment 2.

__Objective:__ Implement a skeleton design for an application that manages a photo gallery. The app uses an Event Driven Architecture and is deployed on the AWS platform. Your solution must include the CDK framework code to provision the app's required infrastructure. 

__Completion date:__ 3/05/2025.

__Weighting:__ 30%.

__Deliverables:__

Submit a text file called `assignment2.txt` to [this link][moodle] on Moodle. The file should contain:
   + The URL of the GitHub repository hosting the code. 
      + __Note__: To avoid plagiarism, you must set your repository visibility to PRIVATE. Shortly after the deadline, I will request that it be set to public visibility so I can assess it. It is not necessary to add me as a collaborator on your repo.
   + The URL of the YouTube video demonstrating the app. 

### Detailed Specification.

The application supports two types of users: Photographer and Moderator. The Photographer can upload photos to an S3 bucket and submit metadata about the photo, including their name, a date and a caption. Uploads are recorded in a database table. The Moderator reviews images and submits their decision on a photo's status, and the app updates the database accordingly. The status options are Pass and Reject. The app notifies the Photographer of a status change by email.  

The application's architecture is illustrated below:

![][arch]

The application should only process  '.jpeg' or '.png' image file types. The Log Image lambda should throw an exception for other file-type upload messages, and SQS should reroute these messages to the DLQ. The Remove Image lambda polls the DLQ and deletes the invalid file from the bucket.

The Log Image lambda records a valid image upload ('.jpeg' or '.png' ) in a DynamoDB table. The table's primary key is the image's file name, e.g. image1.jpeg. Initially, table items have no non-key attributes.

The Photographer can input metadata messages for an image using the AWS CLI. A sample CLI command to add image metadata is as follows:
~~~bash
$ aws sns publish --topic-arn "topic-arn" --message-attributes file://attributes.json --message file://message.json
~~~
These messages should trigger the Add Metadata lambda, which updates the associated table item. The message body should identify the image and contain the metadata value, and the message attribute should provide the metadata's meaning or name. For example, a message to record a __caption__ for an image would  have a body and attribute as follows:
~~~json
 {  // Message Body
   id: 'image1.jpeg',
   value: 'Olympic 100m final - 2024'
 }
{  // Message Attribute
    "metadata_type": {
        "DataType": "String",
        "StringValue": "Caption"
 }
}   
~~~
The only valid attributes are Caption, Date (in string form), and name (Photographer's name). 

The Moderator also uses the CLI to submit messages about the decision from a photo review. In this case, there is only a message body (no message attribute). The schema for these messages is:
~~~json
 {  // Message Body
   id: string,        // Image ID
   date: string,    // e.g. 01/05/2025
   update: {
         status: string,  // Pass or Reject only
         reason: string   // Reason for decision
   }
 }
~~~
These messages should trigger the Update Status lambda, which updates the image's table item - the message's status and reason should be written to the database. The Confirmation Mailer lambda will notify the photographer when an image's status changes.

All subscribers to the SNS topic must __filter out__ irrelevant messages. For example, image metadata messages should not appear in the SQS Queue. 

### Marks Breakdown.

+ Functionality.
   + Photographer
     + Log new Images -          10 marks
     + Metadata updateing -     10 marks
     +  Invalid image removal - 10 marks
     + Status Update Mailer -     10 marks
   + Moderator
      + Status updating -              10 marks
+ Filtering -                                 40 marks
+ Messaging -                            10 marks

### Development strategy.
You should adopt an incremental strategy for your development work by adding new functionality at each stage. Also, at each stage, check that only the intended function(s) execute when they should, i.e. filtering should prevent unnecessary functions from running.
