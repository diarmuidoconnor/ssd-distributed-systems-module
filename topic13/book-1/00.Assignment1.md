## Distributed Systems - Assignment 1.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your understanding of the serverless services available on the AWS platform by designing and developing a skeleton REST API for a context of your choice. Your submission must use the CDK framework to provision the AWS resources required by the API. 

__Completion date:__ 10/11/2024.

__Weighting:__ 20%.

__Deliverables:__

1. A text file (assignment1.txt) containing:
   + The URL of the GitHub repository. 
   + The URL of the YouTube video demonstrating the API. 
   
Notes:
+ The repo README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate. A template will be provided later.
+ Your repo's Git log must have a clear, understandable and coherent history of the work on this assignment. The commit message must summarize the work performed (What task were you working on?) at each stage.

### Detailed Specification.

#### The Web API.

The REST API (App API) should meet the following endpoint requirements:

+ A POST request to add an item to your database table.
+ A parameterized GET request to return a collection of table items, where the parameter represents the table partition key value. 
+ An extension of the above GET request to include a query string option for filtering the items. 
+ A PUT request to update an item.
+ A Get request that returns an item with all its text attributes translated to a specified language, e.g. GET /things/partition_key/sort_key/translation?language=fr (French). Ideally, the API should __perform a translation once__; translations should be persisted and recalled for repeat requests.

#### DynamoDB table design.
The app requires (at least) one table whose primary key is a composite. The attributes should include at least one numeric and string (text) data type. In addition, there should be at least one string-based attribute whose content is long enough for the translation feature.

#### Authentication. 
The app stack should include a separate API (the Auth API) to provide user authentication for the app API. It should allow users to self-register, login, and log out. You are allowed to reuse the Auth API developed in the labs.

#### Authorization.
Only authenticated users are allowed to perform POST and PUT requests, whereas GET requests are public. A table item can only be __updated by the user who added it__. 

#### Amazon Translate.
"Amazon Translate is a Neural Machine Translation (MT) service for translating text between supported languages .... enabling developers to build applications requiring support across multiple languages. The service can be used via an API, enabling either real-time or batch translation of text from the source language to the target language." [AWS Docs][translate]

See [this video][demo] for a demonstration.

### Grading Spectrum.

__Good (40-50%):__

+ Functionality - Support for basic GET (no query string) and POST endpoints.
+ Database: Seeding.

__Very Good (50-65%):__:

+ Functionality - All GET endpoints (excluding translations), POST and the PUT endpoint. PUT constraint.
+ Security - Authentication and Protected routes.

__Excellent (65-85%):__

+ Functionality - Text translations. Persist translations. Repeat translations should be avoided.

__Outstanding (85%+):__

+ Infrastructure - Lamdbd layers or Multi-stack app.

### Development strategy.
You should adopt an incremental approach to the development of this project. Each stage will involve the addition of infrastructure (CDK stack code) and backend functionality (Lambda functions). This approach should be evident in your repository log.
