# Event Driven Architecture.

In this lab, we will demonstrate the event-driven architecture for server-side 
apps. The services used will include S3, SQS (Simple Queue Service), SNS (Simple Notification Service), SES (Simple Email Service), and the Lambda service. The app allows users to upload an image file to an S3 bucket. The S3 bucket publishes the event to an SNS topic with two subscribed  SQS queues. The queues feed the events as messages to a pair of lambda functions. Ome lambda creates a thumbnail of the image, while the other sends an email confirmation message to the user.

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
The stack consists of a single S3 bucket, for now. In the management console, go to the S3 service:

![][bucket]

Note the bucket name in the terminal output as we will need it later:

![][terminal]

[start]: ./img/start.zip
[bucket]: ./img/bucket.png
[terminal]: ./img/terminal.png
