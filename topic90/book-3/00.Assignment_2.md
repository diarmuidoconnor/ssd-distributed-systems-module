## Distributed Systems - Assignment 2.

__Objective:__ Implement a skeleton application for managing a photo album using an Event Driven Architecture on the AWS platform. Your submission must include the CDK framework code to provide the app's required infrastructure. 

__Completion date:__ 6/12/2024.

__Weighting:__ 20%.

__Baseline:__ Use your EDA lab submission as the starting point.

__Deliverables:__

1. A text file (assignment2.txt) containing:
   + The URL of the GitHub repository. 
   + The URL of the YouTube video demonstrating the app. 
   
Notes:
+ The repo README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate. A template will be provided later.
+ Your repo's Git log must be a clear, understandable, and coherent history of the work on this assignment. The commit message must summarize the work performed (What task were you working on?) at each stage.


### Detailed Specification.

### Phase 1 (40-50%),

Extend the baseline architecture to reflect the changes shown below:

![][phase1]

The application should only processes  '.jpeg' or '.png' images. For other file type uploads, the Log Image lambda should throw an exception and SQS should reroute these messages to the DLO. The Rejection Mailer lambda polls the DLQ and emails the user about the rejected file upload.

The Log Image lambda records a valid image upload ('.jpeg' or '.png' ) in a DynamoDB table. The table's primary key is the image's file name, e.g. image1.jpeg. Initially, table items have no non-key attributes.

Note that the Confirmation Mailer lambda is now a direct subscriber to the SNS topic.

### Phase 2 (50-75%),

Extend the phase 1 architecture to reflect the changes shown below:

![][phase2]

A user can add metadata for an image using the AWS CLI. This event should trigger a lambda function (Update Table) that updates the associated table item. The message body should identify the image and contain the metadata value, and the message attribute should provide the metadata's meaning. For example, a message to record a caption for an image would  have a body and attribute as follows:
~~~json
 {  // Body
   id: 'image1.jpeg',
   value: 'My Christmas tree for 2024'
 }
{  // Attribute
    "metadata_type": {
        "DataType": "String",
        "StringValue": "Caption"
 }
}   
~~~
The only valid attributes are Caption, Date (in string form), and Photographer (name).

A sample CLI command to add image metadata is as follows:
~~~bash
$ aws sns publish --topic-arn "topic-arn" --message-attributes file://attributes.json --message file://message.json
~~~

All subscribers to the SNS topic must now __filter out__ irrelevant messages.

### Phase 3 (75+%),

Amend the phase 2 architecture to reflect the changes shown below:

![][phase3]

Users can now delete images from the bucket using the CLI, and these events are sent to the SNS topic to be processed by the Process Image lambda. It deletes the associated item from the table. This case does not require an email message to the user. The CLI command to delete a bucket object is: . The CLI command to delete a bucket object is: 
~~~bash
$ aws s3api delete-object --bucket bucket-name --key object-key
e.g.
$ aws s3api delete-object --bucket edastack-images9bf4dcd5-1xwb81w15o6o --key image1.jpeg
~~~

Note that the Confirmation Mailer lambda is now triggered when a new item is added to the database. To implement this change, please note the following:

+ The signature of this handler is:
~~~ts
import type { DynamoDBStreamHandler } from "aws-lambda";

export const handler: DynamoDBStreamHandler = (event) => {
  .//... code 
}
~~~

+ In the Stack file, you should include the following import statements:
~~~ts
import { StreamViewType } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb";
import {  DynamoEventSource } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-event-sources";
import { StartingPosition } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda";
