## Utility Types.

In `src/myTypes.d.ts`, declare three new types:
~~~ts
export type FriendPartial = Partial<Friend>
// Type for gaining access to an event, e.g. concert
export type EventPass = Omit<Colleague, "contact"> & {
  passCode : number;
}
// Make person's properties immutable.
export type SecureFriendContact = Readonly<Pick<Friend,"name" | "phone" > >
~~~
The FriendPartial type has the same structure as Friend, but all its properties are optional. The EventPass type has the same properties as Colleague except for contact and has an additional property called passCode. The SecureFriendContact type demonstrates the composition of utility types. It generates a type with the same structure as Friend except for age and dob. However, instances of this type are immutable.

Create the file `src/05-utilityTypes.ts` and add the following code:
~~~ts
import { friends, colleagues } from "./01-basics";
import { Friend, Colleague, SecureFriendContact, FriendPartial } from "./myTypes";

function updateFriend(friend: Friend, updates: FriendPartial ) : Friend {
  return { ...friend, ...updates}
}

console.log(updateFriend(friends[0], {
  phone: '08712345',
  dob: new Date("1998-10-22")
}))
~~~
Examine the above code and then run the script.

Add the following to the end of `05-utilityTypes.ts`:
~~~ts
function secureFindFriends(
  friends: Friend[],
  criteria: (f: Friend) => boolean
): SecureFriendContact[] {
  const matches = friends.filter(criteria);
  return matches.map((f) => {
    const secure: SecureFriendContact = {
      name: f.name,
      phone: f.phone,
    };
    return secure;
  });
}
let result = secureFindFriends(
    friends,
    (f: Friend) => f.age < 30
)
console.log(result)
~~~
The new function searches through an array of friends for matches. A read-only copy of each matching object is added to the returned array. To prove the response is read-only, add the following line after the console.log:
~~~ts
result[0].phone = '08654321'
~~~
It causes the following compiler error:

![][error] 

To demonstrate the new EventPass type, suppose we want a function that generates a pass code for a colleague to allow them entry to an event. Add this code to the script file and run it to see its output:
~~~ts
function generateEventPass(colleague: Colleague): EventPass {
  const passCode = Math.round(Math.random() * (1000 - 1) + 1);
  return {
    name: colleague.name,
    department: colleague.department,
    passCode: passCode,
  };
}
console.log(generateEventPass(colleagues.current[0]));
~~~

The __incomplete__ function below finds the intersection of a friends array and a colleagues array, based on matching the name property. It returns an array of objects with a mix of properties from the Friend and Colleagues types, as follows:

+ name
+ age
+ contact:
   + email
   + extension

__You are required__ to complete the function - replace the ?? markers with code and declare any new types required, using utility types where possible.
~~~ts
function intersection(
  friends: Friend[],
  colleagues: Colleague[]
): ?? {
  let result ??
  friends.reduce((res, friend) => {
    const colleague = colleagues.find((col) => col.name === friend.name);
    if (colleague) {
      // Colleague is also a Friend
      ??
    }
    return res;
  }, result);
  return result;
}

console.log(intersection(friends, colleagues.current));
~~~

Commit the above work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Define types using Utility types."
$ git push origin master
