## Interface Data Types.

In the new project, create the folder `src`, and inside it create the file `01-basics.ts`. Paste in the following Javascript code:
~~~js
// (Optional) Change the names below to your friends.

const friend1 = {
  name: "Paul Fleming",
  phone: "087-12345",
  age: 25,
};

const friend2 = {
  name: "Jane Costello",
  phone: "086--12345",
  age: 31,
};

const friends = [friend1, friend2];
console.log(friends[1]);

//   -------------------
const colleague1 = {
  name: "Ralph Graham",
  department: "Engineering",
  contact: {
    email: "rgraham@company.com",
    extension: 121,
  },
};

const colleague2 = {
  name: "Patti Burke",
  department: "Finance",
  contact: {
    email: "pburke@company.com",
    extension: 132,
  },
};

const colleague3 = {
  name: "Dean Sullivan",
  department: "HR",
  contact: {
    email: "dos@company.com",
    extension: 125,
  },
};
const colleagues = {
  current: [colleague1, colleague2, colleague3],
  former: [],
};

console.log(colleagues.current[0]);
~~~

Run this script:
~~~bash
$ npx ts-node src/01-basics.ts
~~~ 
Notice that VS Code reports no TS compiler errors because all JS is valid TS:

![][noprob] 

However, we should make the code more type-safe. At the top of the file, add an interface declaration:
~~~ts
interface Friend {
    name: string;
    phone: string;
    age: number
}
~~~

___You are required___ to apply the Friend data type declaration to all of the variable declarations that relate to friend objects in the script (e.g.friend1, friend2, the friends array). Rerun the script to ensure it still works.

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to friend data."
~~~

___You are required___ to use the same data typing approach to the colleague objects (Ignore the colleagues data structure for now). Pay attention to the Problems panel in VS Code for any errors. Rerun the script when completed.

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to colleague data"
~~~

To complete the data typing for this script, add the following interface declaration:
~~~ts
interface ColleagueHistory {
  current: Colleague[],
  former: Colleague[]
}
~~~
And update the colleagues data structure with this type:
~~~ts
export const colleagues : ColleagueHistory = {
  current: [colleague1, colleague2, colleague3],
  former: [],
};
~~~

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Complete type-safety to colleagues data"
$ git push origin master
~~~
