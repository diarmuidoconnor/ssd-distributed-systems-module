## Type Aliases.

In `myTypes.d.ts`, declare the following types at the end of the file:
~~~ts
export type Department = "Engineering" | "Finance" | "HR";
export interface ColleagueV2 {
  name: string;
  department: Department;    // *****
  contact: {
    email: string;
    extension: number;
    slack?: string;
  };
}

export type Buddy = Friend | ColleagueV2;
export type Administrator = Buddy | string | undefined

export type BuddyList = {
  name: string;
  administrator: Administrator;
  members: Buddy[];
};
~~~

The Department declaration above is termed a Literal Type. We could refactor our Colleague data interface to use Department, but that would trigger lots of compiler errors. Hence, for convenience we declared the ColleagueV2 interface, which we can use from here on. 

Create a new file called `src/03-typeAliases.ts` and add the following code:
~~~ts
import {
  ColleagueV2,
  Friend,
  Buddy,
  BuddyList,
  Administrator,
} from "./myTypes";
import { friends } from "./01-basics";
~~~

Copy the colleague objects from `01-basics.ts` into `03-typeAliases.ts`, but change the type to ColleagueV2, for example:
~~~ts
const colleague1: ColleagueV2 = {
  name: "Ralph Graham",
  department: "Engineering",
  contact: {
    email: "rgraham@company.com",
    extension: 121,
  },
};
~~~
Hover over the 'department' property and check its type - it should be Department instead of string.

Add the following code to the end of `03-typeAliases.ts`:
~~~ts
function makeBuddyList(
  name: string,
  buddies: Buddy[],
  admin?: Administrator
): BuddyList {
  return {
    name,
    members: buddies,
    administrator: admin,
  } as BuddyList;
  // The as operator above casts an object to a specific type.
}
// Tests for makeBuddyList
const myFootballBuddies = makeBuddyList(
  "Football team",
  [colleague1, friends[0], colleague2],
  colleague1
)

const myBandBuddies = makeBuddyList(
    "Band name",
    [colleague1, friends[1]]
    // No administrator
  )

console.log(myFootballBuddies)
console.log(myBandBuddies)
//--------------------------------------
function findBuddyContact(list: BuddyList, name: string): string | undefined {
  for (const buddy of list.members) {
    if (buddy.name === name) {
      if ("phone" in buddy) {
        return buddy.phone;
      }
      else {
        return buddy.contact.email;
      }
    }
    return undefined;
  }
}
// Test for findBuddyContact.
console.log("Contact buddy at: ", findBuddyContact(myFootballBuddies, "Ralph Graham"));
~~~
The 'makeBuddyList' function creates a BuddyList data structure instance. It handles cases when the list's Administrator property is initialized and the case when it's undefined. 

The 'findBuddyContact' function iterates over the members of a BuddyList looking for a Buddy with a specified name. If found, it determines the buddy type (Friend or ColleagueV2) and returns their contact information - the phone number for Friend and the email for ColleagueV2. The conditional statement (if-else) for choosing a Buddy's type is termed __type narrowing__. Note how the compiler infers the correct narrowed type inside the both sides of the statement:

![][narrow1] 

![][narrow2] 


Run the `03-typeAliases.ts` script to ensure you understand it.

-------------------------------

__You are required__ to write a function that returns all the Friends in a buddy list. Its signature should be:
~~~ts
function getBuddyListFriends(list: BuddyList): Friend[] {

~~~
[Hint: Use the array reduce method in the solution, where the objective is to reduce an array of Buddy objects to an array of Friend objects, i.e. only some of the entries in the Buddy array are Friends.]
