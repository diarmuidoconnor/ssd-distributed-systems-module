## Startup.

-------------------------

__[NOTE: This lab work must be submitted to Moodle when completed. You must type the exact git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment. You should spread the effort required to complete the lab over the period involved. See below gor submission detaills.]__

-----------------------------

Create a new folder called `typescriptLab`. In a terminal/shell window, cd to the new folder and type the following setup command sequence:

~~~bash
$ npm init          (Accept the defaults in most cases)
$ npm install -D typescript@4.8.4
$ npm install -D ts-node
$ npx tsc --init     (This creates a default tscongig.json file)
$ git init
~~~
Import the folder into VS Code and create the `.gitignore` file with the following content:
~~~
/node_modules
.vscode
~~~
Open an integrated terminal panel in VS Code and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure."
~~~


### Submission.

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ds-ts-lab'. In VS Code, make this a remote repository for the typescriptLab project using the command:
~~~bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
~~~

Create a text file called 'tsLabWork.txt' and paste the URL of your repo into it. On Moodle, submit the text file at [this link][submit]
