# Basic Serverless app.

We want to create a basic serverless app using the CDK to provision the AWS infrastructure resources needed. The app's architecture is shown below:

![][arch]

### Setup.

Create a new folder (anywhere) called `simple-app`. Execute the following commands:
~~~bash
$ cd simple-app
$ cdk init app --language typescript
~~~
The second command scaffolds a CDK project based on the Typescript implementation choice, and installs some Node modules. However, we need to change some of these modules. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, and replace the content of `package.json` with the following:
~~~json
{
  "name": "simple-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "bin": {
    "simple-app": "bin/simple-app.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "watch": "tsc -w",
    "cdk": "cdk"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/aws-lambda": "^8.10.93",
    "@types/node": "20.4.2",
    "aws-cdk": "2.88.0",
    "esbuild": "^0.18.17",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
    "typescript": "~4.9.5"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb": "^3.67.0",
    "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb": "^3.79.0",
    "@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb": "^3.303.0",
    "aws-cdk-lib": "2.88.0",
    "constructs": "^10.0.0",
    "source-map-support": "^0.5.21"
  }
}
~~~
Run the command:
~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~ 
Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup for lab"
~~~
