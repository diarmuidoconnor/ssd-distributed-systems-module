## Standalone Lambda.

The first version of our CDK app is comprised of one stack containing a standalone lambda function. 

We declare the cloud resources for the app's stack in the file `lib/simple-app-stack.ts`, Replace the content of the file with the following:
~~~ts
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambdanode from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

import { Construct } from 'constructs';
// import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';

export class SimpleAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const simpleFn = new lambdanode.NodejsFunction(this, "SimpleFn", {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambdas/simple.ts`,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
    });

  }
}

~~~
The 'entry' property in the above lambda function configuration refers to the file containing the function's code:
>>entry: `${__dirname}/../lambdas/simple.ts`,

Create a new subfolder of the base called `lambda` and add a file `simple.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
import { Handler } from "aws-lambda";

export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    console.log("I was invoked");
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
      body: { message: "This is a message returned from lambda Function" },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ error }),
    };
  }
};
~~~

Deploying this CDK app involves compiling the lambda function and bundling it with any dependencies, constructing a CloudFormation template, and uploading both to AWS. Type the following command to initiate this:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
[Use the --profile option if necessary.]

To confirm the deployment, go to the AWS web management console and check the following:
+ The CloudFormation service shows the new stack

![][simplestack]

+ The Lambda service shows the lambda function.

![][simplelambda]

We can also use the AWS CLI to query the Lambda service about our function:
~~~bash
$ aws lambda list-functions      // Type Q to quit
~~~
[Use the --profile option here also if relevant.]

A simplest way to trigger (execute) the function is via the CLI using the command:
~~~bash
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name [full function name] response.json
~~~
The response from the list-functions command includes the full function name, for example:
>$ aws lambda invoke --function-name SimpleAppStack-SimpleFn7D0601E0-znMGo1Ft8A60 response.json

The body of the response from the invocation is stored in a file called `response.json` in the project's base folder. It should contain the following:
~~~json
{"statusCode":200,"headers":{"content-type":"application/json"},"body":{"message":"This is a message returned from lambda Function"}}
~~~
[In `.gitignore`, add 'response.json' to prevent it from being comitted to the repository.]

The output from the console.log statements in a lambda function are stored as log streams in the CloudWatch service. In the AWS web management console, navigate to CloudWatch --> Log Groups (left panel) --> Select the log group (e.g. /aws/lambda/SimpleAppStack-SimpleFnxxxxxx) --> Select the most recent Log Stream ( bottom of the page) based on the timestamps:
  
![][logstream]

CloudWatch log streams are very helpful when debugging lambda functions.

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Simple standalone lambda"
