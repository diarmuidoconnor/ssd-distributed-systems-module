## Debugging with Cloudwatch. 

----------------------
### Cleanup.

We should do some cleanup before sorking through this section. In the management console, go to the Cloudwatch service --> Log groups and delete all the groups by selecting them and choosing the Delete action: 

![][deletelog]

-----------------------------

In `getMovieById.ts`, the handler starts by extracting the movie id from the event object parameter. Note the console log statement at the beginning of the function. We can use the output from this statement to explore the shape of the event object. First, trigger the function by requesting a movie (say, 1234) from a browser tab. Then, in the management console, go to  CloudWatch --> Log Groups (left panel) --> Select the '/aws/lambda/SimpleAppStack-GetMovieByIdFn' group --> Select the Log steam --> Expand the stream section generated by the console log statement: 

![][eventshape1]

Locate the query string parameter in the structure:

![][eventshape2]

Cloudwatch can also be useful when examining the structure of responses from the DynamoDB SDK (or and SDK). For example, add a console log statement to `getMovieById.ts` as follows:
~~~ts
   const commandOutput = await ddbDocClient.send(
     ... as before ...
    );
    console.log('GetCommand response: ', commandOutput)  // NEW
    if (!commandOutput.Item) {
      ... as before ...
~~~
Update the stack (cdk deploy), and resubmit a request for movie 1234 from the browser tab. The Cloudwatch log stream for the new log statement looks as follows:

![][getcommand]

A common error when developing lambda functions is insufficient IAM permissions to access other AWS services, such as DynamoDB. In `simple-app-stack.ts` comment out the line:
~~~ts
    moviesTable.grantReadData(getMovieByIdFn)
~~~

Update the stack (cdk deploy) and try requesting movie 1234 from the browser again. An error response is returned this time:

![][accessdenied1]

In cases where a lanbda function is not triggered by a browser request, we need another means of identifying the error thrown (we will encounter them later in the module). To simulate this, temporarily comment out the catch-block in `getMovieById.ts`. Update the stack (cdk deploy) and try requesting movie 1234. This time we get a generic 'Internal Server Error'. To debug this, go to Cloudwatch and find the log stream for this invocation of the function:

![][accessdenied2]

You will frequently need to debug lambda functions via CloudWatch logs in this way. 

__Undo all the above code changes__, update the stack and check the get movie feature is working again.
