## Simple DynamoDB.

DynamoDB is a serverless NoSQL database service from AWS. We want to use the CDK framework to create a DynamoDB table. 

In `simple-app-stack.ts` add an import at the top:
~~~ts
import * as dynamodb from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb";
~~~
Add a Table declaration (after the function URL statement, although the sequence does not matter):
~~~ts
    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
         ... as before ...
    );
    const moviesTable = new dynamodb.Table(this, "MoviesTable", {
      billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
      partitionKey: { name: "movieId", type: dynamodb.AttributeType.NUMBER },
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
      tableName: "Movies",
    });
~~~
Update the stack by redeploying (cdk deploy). In the management console, go to the DynamoDB service and click Tables (left panel). Movies should appear in the table list:

![][dynamodb]
.
Sometimes, we'd like to execute some logic AFTER AWS has created the infrastructure, for example, seeding a database. The CDK framework provides the AWSCustomREsource construct for this edge use case. We can configure this construct to execute any command, for example, the DynamoDB SDK PutItem command, to write an item to a table. Internally, the CDK __dynamically creates a lambda function__ to perform the task defined by a custom resource. (AWSCustomRrsource is an advanced concept; we need not be overly concerned about it after this lab.) 

For convenience, we will use some data from the [TMDB web API][tmdb] as our seed data. Create a new folder in the project called `shared`  and add a file called `types.d.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
export type Language = 'English' | 'French'

export type Movie = {
    movieId: number;
    genre_ids: number[];
    original_language : Language;
    overview: string;
    popularity: number;
    release_date: string;
    title: string
    video: boolean;
    vote_average: number;
    vote_count: number
  }
~~~
Create a new folder in the project called `seed`  and add a file called `movies.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
import {Movie} from '../shared/types'

export const movies : Movie[] = [
  {
    movieId: 1234,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'English',
    overview:
      "Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.",
    popularity: 2633.943,
    release_date: "2020-11-20",
    title: "Title 1234",
    video: false,
    vote_average: 5.9,
    vote_count: 111,
  },
  {
    movieId: 4567,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'French',
    overview:

    popularity: 2633.943,
    release_date: "2020-11-20",
    title: "Title 1234",
    video: false,
    vote_average: 5.9,
    vote_count: 111,
  },
  {
    movieId: 2345,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'English',
    overview:

];

Create the file `shared/util.ts` and add the following code:
~~~ts
import { marshall } from "@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb";
import { Movie } from "./types";

export const generateMovieItem = (movie: Movie) => {
  return {
    PutRequest: {
      Item: marshall(movie),
    },
  };
};

export const generateBatch = (data: Movie[]) => {
  return data.map((e) => {
    return generateMovieItem(e);
  });
};

~~~
Finally, in `simple-app-stack.ts` add some import statements:
~~~ts
import * as custom from "aws-cdk-lib/custom-resources";
import { generateBatch } from "../shared/util";
import {movies} from "../seed/movies";
~~~
And add an AWSCustomResource, as follows:
~~~ts
    const moviesTable = new dynamodb.Table(this, "MoviesTable", {
       ... as before ...
    });

    new custom.AwsCustomResource(this, "moviesddbInitData", {
      onCreate: {
        service: "DynamoDB",
        action: "batchWriteItem",
        parameters: {
          RequestItems: {
            [moviesTable.tableName]: generateBatch(movies),
          },
        },
        physicalResourceId: custom.PhysicalResourceId.of("moviesddbInitData"), //.of(Date.now().toString()),
      },
      policy: custom.AwsCustomResourcePolicy.fromSdkCalls({
        resources: [moviesTable.tableArn],
      }),
    });
~~~
This custom resource has the following characteristics:
+ It only runs when the stack is initially created, not on subsequent updates (onCreate)
+ Its purpose is to perform a 'batchWriteItem' action on the  DynamoDB service
+ An IAM policy is created and attached to the execution role of the particular lambda function that performs the seeding. The policy is dynamically created based on the task it must perform, i.e. add an item to a table.

Because the custom resource only runs on stack creation, we should destroy the current one first and then redeploy:
~~~bash
$ cdk destroy
$ cdk deploy
~~~
In the management console, go to the DYnamoDB service --> click Tables on the left panel --> click the Movies hyperlink in the tables list --> click the 'Explore Table Items' button (top right), and scroll down. The items should appear as shown:

![][moviestable]

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Create movies table and seed it."
