## ALB-EC2 stack

Our objective is to deploy the following application stack to your AWS account using the CDK framework:

![][schema]

The EC2 instance will host a Web API built on the Node/Express platform - it's a skeleton of the Web API from the Web App Development 2 module last year. The API communicates with a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB.com. The database is already created and set up with user access credentials for your convenience. 
This infrastructure configuration is sophisticated, but its it's based on a traditional model, i.e. it's not serverless based. For this reason, we need not delve into HOW the deployment works but instead appreciate WHAT is possible with the Infrastructure as Code technique. We will explore how things work in subsequent labs.

The code for this stack can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)

>>$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI

Import the `cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)` folder into VS Code, open an integrated terminal, and install the  dependencies:
~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~

In `lib/user-data-API.sh`, change the line:
~~~bash
export MONGO_DB=db-url
~~~
to the following:
~~~bash
export MONGO_DB='mongodb+srv://readwriteuser:q1w2e3r4@doconnor-atlas-cluster.vddmf.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
~~~

To deploy the stack to your AWS account, type the command:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
[Include the --profile option if relevant.]

Assuming the deployment was successful, the terminal output includes the domain name of the newly created Application Load Balancer resource:

![][alb]

Copy the name and paste it into a browser tab:
[If you receive a '502 Bad Gateway' response, wait a few seconds and refresh the browser tab.]

![][root]

The above response confirms the Node-Express API server is running inside the EC2 instance. In the browser, add `api/movies` to the end of the domain name URL: 

![][api]

The response above confirms the API server is successfully communicating with the MongoDB database. 

In the AWS management console, check the stack deployment in CloudFormation:

![][cf]

The stack comprised of several resources, for example:

- An EC2 instance.
- An Application load balancer (ALB), with one listener on port 60.
- An Auto Scaling group (ASG) for scaling the EC2 instance. The ASG is the target for the ALB listener.
- A Security group for the EC2 instance(s), with one ingress rule.

Use the management console to find these resources, for example:

![][ec2]

![][albmc]

### Infrastructure State Management.

In the management console, go to the EC2 console and navigate to the security group declared for the EC2 instance by clicking 'Security Groups' on the left panel and then find the group with 'cdk-stack-webserversg' in its name: 

![][secgrp]

The security group currently has one inbound rule defined. To demonstrate the state management feature of the CDK framework (and, by implication, CloudFormation's support for state management), in VS Code, open the file `lib/cdk-stack.ts` and uncomment the lines:

~~~ts
    serverSG.addIngressRule(
      Peer.anyIpv4(),
      Port.tcp(22),
      'allow SSH access from anywhere',
    );
~~~
This code adds a second rule to the security group of the server (EC2). Now update the stack's state by redeploying the app using the same command:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
[Include the --profile option if relevant.]

Type 'y' to allow CloudFormation to apply the changes to your deployed resources.

When the deployment is complete, recheck the security group in the AWS management console to confirm the __state change__ has occurred:

![][secgrp2]

Change the same lines of code back to comments and run the deploy command again. Cloudformation will update the state by removing the rule from the inbound list. 

### Cleanup

To avoid incurring any cost, destroy the entire stack from your AWS account with the command:
~~~bash
$ cdk destroy
~~~
[Include the --profile option if relevant.]

Go to the Cloudformation service page of the AWS management page and confirm it deleted the stack for this demo app. As well, all the related resources were deleted. For example, check the EC2 instance is removed/terminated. Check some of the other resources as well.
