# The Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) lets you define cloud infrastructure as code in various programming languages - we will use Typescript. Once defined, you can then provision the resources of that infrastructure using the CDK CLI. 

### CDK Bootstrap.

Install the AWS CDK CLI globally using the following command (use the VS Code integrated terminal for convenience):
~~~bash
$ npm install -g aws-cdk@2.80.0
~~~
Run the following command to verify a correct installation:
~~~bash
$ cdk --version
~~~

To deploy resources using the AWS CDK framework, your AWS account requires a dedicated S3 bucket and some other containers to be available - the AWS CloudFormation service uses them during deployment. Creating these is called __bootstrapping__. First, you need to discover the 12-digit identification number for your AWS account using the following command:
~~~bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
~~~
Now bootstrap your AWS account with the following command:
~~~bash
$ cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/eu-west-1
~~~
>>e.g. cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/eu-west-1

__NOTE:__ The above command assumes you ar using your__ default profile__ to access your account. If not, then include the --profile option in the command, e.g.
~~~bash
$ cdk --profile myProfileName bootstrap aws://YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/eu-west-1
~~~
In fact, all cdk commands must include the --profile option in this scenario.


Confirm that this worked by navigating to the CloudFormation service in the AWS web management console and checking for the presence of the CDKToolkit stack:

Bootstrapping also creates an S3 bucket to store assets required by the CDK. __NEVER DELETE__ any resources created by the bootstrapping process.
