## Lambda function URLs.

Function URLs allow us to invoke a lambda function using any HTTP client (e.g. Postman). 

In `lib/simple-app-stack.ts`, change the configuration of the lambda function to include a URL identifier, as follows:
~~~ts
   const simpleFn = new lambdanode.NodejsFunction(this, "SimpleFn", {
      ... as before ....
    });

    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
      authType: lambda.FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE,
      cors: {
        allowedOrigins: ["*"],
      },
    });

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "Simple Function Url", { value: simpleFnURL.url });
~~~
For convenience we are outputting the generated URL using the CDK L1 construct CfnOutput. 

Update the app's deployment:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
The terminal response should resemble the following:

Test the URL using a web browser as shown below:

![][browserres]

We can also use the web management console to find the URL generated for the function. Go to Lambda Service and navigate to the function's page - see illustration below:

### Protected URL.

A function URL can be configured as private/protected, so only HTTP requests with a valid authentication token can trigger it. The Lambda service uses the AWS SigV4 protocol for token generation. 

In `simple-app-stack.ts`, change the function URL creation statement to the following:
~~~ts
    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
      authType: lambda.FunctionUrlAuthType.AWS_IAM,   // CHANGE
      cors: {
        allowedOrigins: ["*"],
      },
    });
~~~
Update the deployment:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
Try to access the function URL in the browser. The response is a '403 Forbidden access' because the request is not appropriately signed. Using the Postman HTTP client (install from [here][postman] ), create a new HTTP request. Use the URL of the lambda function and set the authentication type to AWS Signature. Use your personal AWS Access key and AWS Secret access key in the settings, as well as eu-west-1 for the region and lambda for the service - see screenshot.

Click Send. The response should now contain the function's 200 response body.
