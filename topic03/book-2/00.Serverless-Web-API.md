## Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab, we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL. A better design would be to have a uniform entry point to the lambda functionality by placing an AWS API Gateway between the client and the backend. The Gateway allows us to define a REST interface to the backend based on serverless technology. The diagram below shows our target infrastructure:

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. It's a partial solution to the previous lab  with minor filename changes, e.g. lib/simple-app.ts renamed lib/rest-api-stack.ts. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In the management console, check Cloudformation for the new stack:

### Submission.

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ds-serverlessREST-lab'. In VS Code, make this a remote repository for the project using the command:
~~~bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
~~~

Create a text file called `serverlessLabWork.txt`` and paste the URL of your repo into it. On Moodle, submit the text file at [this link][submit].
