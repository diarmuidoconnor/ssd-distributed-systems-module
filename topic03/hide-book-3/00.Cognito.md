# Cognito Authentication.

In this lab, we will use the AWS Cognito service to add user authentication to a simple web API. The CDK will provision the following AWS resources:

+ A Cognito User pool.
+ An API to perform Authentication processing - The Auth web API.
+ An API to demonstrate public and protected REST endpoints - the App API.
+ A custom authorizer to prevent unauthorized requests accessing protected routes.

A visual representation of the CDK stack is demonstrated below:

The Auth API will provide endpoints (REST resources) that allow a user to issue the following requests:

+ User SignUp.
+ SignUp confirmation.
+ User SignIn.
+ User Signout.

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the following commands:

~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts`, the code provisions a Cognito User Pool, an AppClient for this pool, and a skeleton REST API. In the AWS management console, go to Cognito Service --> User Pools (left panel), and confirm the creation of the user pool:

![][userpool]

Notice in `lib/auth-app-stack.ts` that the Stack class declares some private instance variables, i.e.
~~~ts
export class AwsServerlessAuthStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;
~~~
These variables are initialized in the constructor method, for example:
~~~ts
    this.userPoolId = userPool.userPoolId;
~~~
These instance variables are accessible by any of the class' methods (see below). 

The authentication web API (Auth API) will have several elements similar in structure. We can define a private method in the class to reduce code duplication for declaring these common elements. In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts`, define the method as follows:
~~~ts
export class AuthAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    .... as before .....
  }
// NEW
  private addAuthRoute(
    resourceName: string,
    method: string,
    fnName: string,
    fnEntry: string,
    allowCognitoAccess?: boolean
  ): void {
    const commonFnProps = {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
      handler: "handler",
      environment: {
        USER_POOL_ID: this.userPoolId,
        CLIENT_ID: this.userPoolClientId,
        REGION: cdk.Aws.REGION
      },
    };
    
    const resource = this.auth.addResource(resourceName);
    
    const fn = new node.NodejsFunction(this, fnName, {
      ...commonFnProps,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambdas/auth/${fnEntry}`,
    });

    resource.addMethod(method, new apig.LambdaIntegration(fn));
  }  // end private method
} // end class
~~~

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup for Auth APII."

### Verified Sender Identities.

By default, an AWS account is in __sandbox mode__. One consequence is that you can only use the AWS SES (Simple Email Service) to send emails to your __verified sender identities__, with a typical limit of 200 emails daily. A verified sender identity is an email address or domain you confirmed ownership of. 

In this lab's application, we want to email users on signup. Therefore, you must first add their email address to your verified sender identities. Create a verified sender identity for any email addresses you can access by performing the steps in [this guide][vsi] (scroll to the section titled "Creating an email address identity" on the page). We will use these email addresses when demonstrating user registration later.
