## Exercise

__You are required__ to add a new lambda function, with an associated URL, that returns all the movies in the table. The DynamoDBDocumentClient command to get all items from a table is ScanCommand, e.g.
~~~ts
   new ScanCommand({
        TableName: string;
      })
~~~
The function's response should look as follows:

![][getall]

On completion, commit the work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Lambda function to get all movies."
~~~

[getall]: ./img/getall.png
