-----------------------------------


You now use the downloaded access keys to configure the AWS CLI on your local computer. (assuming you have installed the CLI already) From the command line type:
~~~bash
$ aws configure
~~~
Enter the two access keys from the CSV file and set the Region to eu-west-1.

Test that it worked with:
~~~bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
~~~
It should respond with youe 12-digit account number.
