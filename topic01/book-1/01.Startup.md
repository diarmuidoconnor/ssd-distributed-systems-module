## Startup.

**[NOTE: This lab work must be submitted to Moodle when completed. You must type the exact git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment. You should spread the effort required to complete the lab over the period involved. See below gor submission detaills.]**

---

Create a new folder called `typescriptLab`. Open a terminal/shell window and navigate to the new folder using the cd command. Now type the following setup command sequence:

```bash
$ npm init          (Accept the defaults in most cases)
$ npm install -D typescript@4.8.4
$ npm install -D ts-node
$ npx tsc --init     (This creates a default tscongig.json file)
$ git init
```

Import the `typescriptLab` folder into VS Code and create a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```
/node_modules
.vscode
```

Open an integrated terminal panel in VS Code by clicking the Terminal drop-down menu and select New Terminal. Type the following commands at the terminal prompt:

```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure."
```

### Submission.

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ds-ts-lab'. In VS Code, make this a remote repository for the typescriptLab project using the command:

```bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
```

Create a text file called 'tsLabWork.txt' and paste the URL of your repo into it. Log in to Moodle and submit the text file at [this link][submit].
