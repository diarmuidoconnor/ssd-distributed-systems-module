## Functions.

### Setup.
Create the file `src/myTypes.d.ts` and add the following declarations:
~~~ts

export interface Friend {
    name: string;
    phone: string;
    age: number
}

export interface Colleague {
    name: string;
    department: string;
    contact: {
      email: string;
      extension: number
    } 
  }

export interface ColleagueHistory {
  current: Colleague[],
  former: Colleague[]
}
~~~
In `01-basics.ts`, make the following changes: 
+ Add an import at the top:
~~~ts
import {Friend, Colleague, ColleagueHistory } from './myTypes'
~~~
+ Remove the three redundant interface declarations (created in the previous section).
+ Comment out all the 'console.log()` statements.
+ Export the collection data structures:
~~~ts
export const friends = [friend1, friend2];

export const colleagues = { ... as before ...};
~~~

Create the file `src/02-functions.ts` and add this line:
~~~ts
import {Friend, Colleague } from './myTypes'
~~~

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor - Add type declaration file; disable redundant console logs."
$ git push origin master
~~~
### Typed function signatures.

Add the following code to `02-functions.ts`:
~~~ts
function older(f: Friend) : string {
     f.age += 1
     return `${f.name} is now ${f.age}` 
}

console.log(older(friends[0]))
~~~
Note the function's parameter type and return type. Run the script:
~~~bash
$ npx ts-node  src/02-functions.ts 
~~~

-----------------

__You are required to__ add a new function, called 'allOlder', that takes an array of friend objects, increments each one's age by one year, and returns the new ages as an array of strings. For example, the statement:
~~~ts
console.log(allOlder(friends))
~~~
should output:
~~~bash
[ 'Paul Fleming is now 27', 'Jane Costello is now 32' ]
~~~
Please complete this exercise before continuing.

--------------------

Next, add the following code to the end of the file:
~~~ts
// Find the colleague with the highest extension number.
function highestExtension(cs: Colleague[]): Colleague {
  const result = cs.sort(
    (c1, c2) => c1.contact.extension - c2.contact.extension
  );
  return result[cs.length - 1];
}
console.log(highestExtension(colleagues.current));
~~~
The 'highestExtension' function returns the colleague with the highest extension number. It sorts the array of colleagues in ascending extension number order and then picks the last entry in the sorted array. Run the script to confirm it works.

__You are required to__ wrute a function called 'addColleague' that adds a colleague to an array, and setting their extensins number to the highest extension, plus 1. To test your implementation, add the following code to end of the script:
~~~ts
addColleague(colleagues.current, "Sheild O Connell", "HR", "soc@here.com");
console.log(colleagues.current.filter((c) => c.name === "Sheild O Connell"));
~~~
It should output the following:
~~~bash
[
  {
    name: 'Sheild O Connell',
    department: 'HR',
    contact: { email: 'soc@here.com', extension: 133 }
  }
]
~~~

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Typed function signature."
$ git push origin master
~~~

### Type inference.

Notice how the compiler infers the type of the result from the array sort method:

![][infer] 

In many cases, the compiler can infer the type of a variable. For example, make the change below:
~~~ts
function highestExtension(cs: Colleague[]) { // Inferred retun type
  const result = cs.sort(
    (c1, c2) => c1.contact.extension - c2.contact.extension
  );
  return result[cs.length - 1];
}
~~~

When we check the signature with VS Code's intellisense, it is still correct:

![][infer2] 

__You are required to__ leverage type inferencing in the other functions in the script. It does not need to be exhaustive, and always keep an eye on the Problems panel of VS Code.


### Higher Order functions.

Suppose we want a function that takes an array of colleagues and a sorting criterion, and returns the sorted data, but only includes names and emails in the  response. First, add a new data interface to `myTypes.d.ts`:
~~~ts
export interface EmailContact {
    name: string;
    email: string
}
~~~
Now, add the following code to the end of `02-functions.ts`:
~~~ts
function sortColleagues(
  colleagues: Colleague[],
  sorter: (c1: Colleague, c2: Colleague) => number
): EmailContact[] {
  const sorted = colleagues.sort(sorter); // Colleague[] inferred
  const result: EmailContact[] = sorted.map((ce) => ({ name: ce.name, email: ce.contact.email }));
  return result 
}

console.log(sortColleagues(colleagues.current, (a, b) => a.contact.extension - b.contact.extension));
console.log(sortColleagues(colleagues.current, (a, b) => a.name.length - b.name.length));
~~~
The type for the second argument of 'sortColleagues' is a callback (function) that takes two Colleague objects and returns a numeric value computed from comparing them. SortColleagues uses the callback to sort the array of colleagues. The two console.log statements test the new function. The first one provides a callback that sorts colleagues by extension number, and the second one uses the length of a colleague's name as the sorting criteria. Run the script to see the results.

----------------------

__You are required to__ write a function called 'findFriends' that searches an array of friends for those that satisfy a criterion. The criterion is specified as a callback. For example, consider these two invocations of the function:
~~~ts
console.log(findFriends(friends, (friend) => friend.name.startsWith('Pa')));
console.log(findFriends(friends, (friend) => friend.age < 35));
~~~
They would output the following results (assuming you did not alter the original friends array):
~~~bash
[ 'Paul Fleming' ]
[ 'Paul Fleming', 'Jane Costello' ]
~~~

~~~bash
